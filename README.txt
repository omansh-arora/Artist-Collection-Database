Instructions for Compiling and Running
--------------------------------------

Type "make" in the shell

(put instructions here for compiling and running your program; hopefully it's
just to type "make" in the shell!)


Limitations
-----------

- No NCurses 
- Cannot have commas in database.txt except to seperate different fields
- Can only enter integers between 0-200 (As no one's age is above 200 and no artist has over 200 albums)

(if you didn't implement all requested features, list which ones are missing)


Known Bugs
----------

- Sometimes adds unknown character at the end of the database file upon exit, don't know why, TA couldn't solve it either
- Not a bug, but the format for the database.txt file is: (Artist,Age,Genre,Number of albums)\\CANNOT ADD SPACES AFTER COMMA

(list all known bugs here)
