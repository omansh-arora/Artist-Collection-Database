# Artist-Collection-Database

This project is a database made in C++ which reads in a .txt input file and creates a database of artists from it. It has a interface where you can add, find, delete, and list all the artists in the database with a wide variety of options such as sorted alphabetically, by age, by number of albums etc. After the user is done modifying the database through the interface, the changes are all saved to the text file upon exit.
